LangChain Research Assistant - Beginner-Friendly Version
This version only requires an Anthropic API key and includes detailed explanations

WHAT THIS DOES:
1. Creates AI analyst personas for different perspectives
2. Each analyst "interviews" an expert (another AI) about your topic
3. Combines all interviews into a comprehensive research report
4. Uses only Wikipedia for research (no paid APIs needed)

# FLOW SUMMARY FOR BEGINNERS
# ================================

"""
üîÑ COMPLETE FLOW EXPLANATION:

1. SETUP PHASE:
   - Import LangChain libraries
   - Get your Anthropic API key
   - Create Claude AI model instance

2. ANALYST CREATION:
   - You provide a research topic
   - AI creates 3 different expert personas (e.g., scientist, policy maker, industry expert)
   - Each has different expertise and perspective

3. INTERVIEW PHASE (for each analyst):
   - Analyst asks a question about the topic
   - System searches Wikipedia for relevant information
   - Expert (AI) answers using the research context
   - Repeat for 2-3 rounds per analyst

4. REPORT GENERATION:
   - Each interview gets converted to a report section
   - All sections are combined into one comprehensive report
   - Final report includes summary, analysis, and conclusions

5. OUTPUT:
   - Complete research report saved as markdown file
   - Option to display on screen

üéØ KEY CONCEPTS:
- Chains: Reusable workflows (Prompt ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Parser)
- Personas: Different AI characters for diverse perspectives
- Context: Background information fed to AI for better answers
- Pydantic: Data validation and structure
- Sequential Processing: One step after another (vs parallel)

üîß WHAT YOU NEED:
- Just an Anthropic API key (no other paid services)
- Python packages: langchain, langchain-anthropic, langchain-community, pydantic, wikipedia
